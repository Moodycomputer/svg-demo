# Pointy

An angular prototyping boilerplate for making really quick things?

##Setup

This is all nodey, so all you need to so to start is navigate to the directory and run `npm install`.

Pointy is dependant on Gulp. If you don't already have Gulp installed globally, you can do so by running `npm install -g gulp`

## Running

To start the HTTP server and begin the LESS processing, simply run `gulp serve`.
